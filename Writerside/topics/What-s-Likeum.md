# What&apos;s Likeum?

Likeum is our in-house Godot framework system. It's a collection of modules and
tools that we use to make our games. It's a successor to Lumina, which was our
previous framework. You can find
Lumina [here](https://github.com/superposedinteractive/lumina).

Likeum is closed-source software, but we do have an SDK that you can use to
make your own games. You can find it [here](https://example.com).

## Key Features

- **Modular**: Likeum is designed to be modular, so you can pick and choose
  which modules you want to use.

  focus on making your game.

- **Easy Updating**: The "launcher" checks for module updates on runtime.
